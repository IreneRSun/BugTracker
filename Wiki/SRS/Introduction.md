# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the creation of a bug tracker, which is a program that keeps track of software errors.

## 1.2 Product Value
For large pieces of code, no developer can guarantee that the code will work exactly as intended for every user, in every case, without testing.
And often even with comprehensive test cases, errors that need to be fixed arise.
This is where a bug tracker is helpful.
A bug tracker is a program where users can report and keep track of bugs.
It manages bug fixing tasks and offers a streamlined process to provide and address software feedback.

## 1.3 Project Scope
This project aims to make developing quality software easier for software teams with a user-friendly application that tracks bugs and their status.
It will help developers assign error-fixing tasks and track their progress, 
which is particularily useful in teams as coordination is vital to develop a quality product efficiently.

## 1.4 Intended Audience and Use
For software developers, particularily teams of developers, this program is intended for tracking bugs and project targets when developing software.
While for regular users, this program is designed for reporting bugs they have experienced while using software.
